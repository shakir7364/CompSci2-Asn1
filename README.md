# Computer Science II Assignment 1
First assignment in exception handling. The project contains mostly blank classes that extend the Exception class and a MyLibrary class with commented instructions on what to complete for the assignment. The assignment was to write the following methods:
* Method 1 CalcFee(): Calculate and return fee for a given value or throw a CreditException if value is out of bounds
* Method 2 fac(): Calculate and return factorial for a given value or throw a FacException if value is out of bounds
* Method 3 locate(): Locate first instance of double value and return its index or -1 if not found and throw an ArrayException if array passed is null or empty
* Method 4 getInteger(): Get user input and return it as an int if the string entered was an integer. Prompt user for input again by catching a NumberFormatException if their input was not an integer
* Method 5 substitute(): Replace characters in a given string with new characters and return the final string. Throw an InvalidStringException for a passed string that is either null or empty. 
* Method 6 sine(): Calculate and return sine. Throw an AngleException if angle is out of bounds and a FacException if the number of terms is 0 or less.
